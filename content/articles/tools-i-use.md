Here is a list of some of the tools I use day-to-day.


# Software

- [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) ---
	One of the most solid barebones Linux distros I know of.
	I use it on my desktop and laptop computers.
- [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) ---
	Secure server operating system.
	I use it to serve this website.

	Unlike a GNU/Linux distro, OpenBSD is a single homogeneous system.
	Everything makes sense and the documentation is really good.
	Reminds me of [Plan 9](https://plan9.io/plan9/) in that respect.

- [Acme](http://acme.cat-v.org/) ---
	Originally developed for Plan 9, Acme is [Rob Pike's](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/) user interface for programmers.
	It's what we now call an IDE.
	I'm writing this article in Acme right now.

	Every piece of text in Acme can be a executed or piped into/out-of a script.
	Very powerful.
- [Dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) ---
	Nice tiling window manager for X11.
	Goes well with other Suckless accoutrements.
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) ---
	Syncthing is a sort of distributed filesystem.
	I use it to synchronize files between my laptop, desktop, and phone.


# Hardware

- [Thinkpad T420s](https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T420s) ---
	I've had this laptop for a few years now; no complaints.

	I replaced the hard drive with an SSD and threw some extra DDR3 in there.
	The 10+ year old 4-thread Sandy Bridge i5 is actually fine.
	I'm waiting for someone to make a [serious multithreaded](https://netlib.org/utk/papers/advanced-computers/tera.html) RISC-V CPU, but unfortunately everyone seems to be obsessed with high clock speeds and out-of-order-execution chips that use as much die space and power as possible.
	That [Esperanto ET-SoC-1](https://youtu.be/LmUu-lN7D0k) looked promising, but apparently they went out of business or something?

	Anyway, the T420s has a sturdy magnesium frame, a good keyboard, and a three-button touchpad which is essential for Acme and CAD programs---I don't know how people live without one.

- iPod mini 1G ---
	Hard to find a phone with a headphone jack these days.
	The mini has one, as well as physical buttons and a touch rotary encoder---much nicer than using a touchscreen imo.
	I want to get a full size iPod 1G with the physical scroll wheel at some point.

	I replaced the battery with a new one and replaced the tiny (both physically and in terms of storage space) hard drive with a 128GB SD card.
	Running [RockBox](https://www.rockbox.org/).
	Works mint.

- Casio F-91W ---
	Cheap wristwatch that keeps time---what can I say?
	If it's good enough for [al-Qaeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W#Usage_in_terrorism) then it's good enough for me.

	Supposedly this is the most-sold watch in the world.
	Casio has been making it since 1989.

- [USBtin](https://www.fischl.de/usbtin/) ---
	Simple USB-to-CAN interface by Thomas Fischl.
	Works with [SocketCAN](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/can.html).
	Used to test and debug systems that incorporate a CAN bus, like [this](http://git.samanthony.xyz/can-gauge-interface.git/).

- [Espotek Labrador](https://espotek.com/labrador/) ---
	Combined oscilloscope, signal generator, power supply, logic analyzer, and multimeter.
	Obviously a tiny $30 board is not as good as real lab equipment, but it's small and cheap and good enough for now.
