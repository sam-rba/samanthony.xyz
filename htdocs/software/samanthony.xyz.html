		The site uses HTML templates to avoid tedium and for the ability to make
		small changes across the entire site without editing multiple files. It uses
		the html/template package included in Go's standard library.
	</p>
	<p>
		A server is required to serve these templates. Once again Go provides with
		the built in http package. This makes writing a web server extremely easy.
		All you have to do is write a function to handle incoming requests and call
		http.ListenAndServe(). Painless.

		Since I'm running OpenBSD, TLS can be dealt with external to the webserver
		by using relayd. As an aside, I encourage anyone looking for an operating
		system to give OpenBSD a look. It's been an absolute pleasure to work with
		so far. As long as you don't expect it to be exactly like a Linux-based
		system (it's not), then not only is it more secure, but also
		<em>easier to use</em> than something Linux-based. Even for a noob like
		myself. Sane design and good documentation go a long way.

	<p>
		Inspiration was taken from httpd and the server runs chroot'd. When
		serving content it also drops down to an unprivileged user with setuid.
