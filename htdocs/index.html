		<h1>Why This Site Exists</h2>
		<hr>
	</header>

	<p>
		Most of the modern Web sucks. This is my futile attempt at changing that.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many sites these days try to solve problems that don't exist using improper
		tools and techniques to do so. The classic example is JavaScript;
		client-side scripting can be quite useful <em>in certain situations</em>.
		The problem, however, is that most situations are not these situations.
	</p>

	<p>
		The vast majority of websites could be simple HTML( + CSS) pages and gain all
		the benefits that go along with that, namely <em>simplicity</em>,
		<em>speed/performance</em> and
		<a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/Blog/2015/04/24/0/">
			<em>reliability</em></a>.
		Instead, people choose to complicate things.
	</p>

	<blockquote><p>"Install this plugin!"</p></blockquote>
	<blockquote><p>"Use this framework!"</p></blockquote>

	<p>
		Rather than fixing the underlying problem by stripping back the layers to
		find that we really just want to render some HTML, we instead pile more
		on top, obscuring and worsening whatever problem we think we're trying to
		solve.

		Some common excuses for "I need to use x:"
		<ul>
			<li>
				"It's responsive"
				<br>
				<p style="margin: 0px;" class="hanging-indent">
					Setting this meta tag:
					<code data-lang="html">
						<span class="t">&lt;<span class="e">meta</span>
							<span class="an">name</span>=<span class="av">"viewport"</span>
							<span class="an">content</span>=<span class="av">"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</span>&gt;
						</span>
					</code>
					along with some very basic CSS is all that's required for a
					responsive site that looks good on any screen.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				"It looks nicer"
				<p style="margin: 0px;" class="hanging-indent">
					Java<em>Script</em>. Cascading
					<em>Style</em> Sheets. See the problem?
					Don't use scripts for styling. Also, no, it doesn't look nicer.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				"It's makes for a better user experience"
				<p style="margin: 0px" class="hanging-indent">
					If you like waiting seconds for a page to load before scrolling an
					entire screen height with a parallaxed background just to read two
					words then yes, that is a good experience.
					Personally, I would rather not have to hover my cursor through a maze
					of eight nested, animated drop-down menus while being bombarded by
					popups asking for personal information and telling me that the site
					uses
					<a href="https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2010/10/http-cookies-or-how-not-to-design.html">
						cookies</a>.
